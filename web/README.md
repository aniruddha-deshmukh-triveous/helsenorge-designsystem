## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

The Helsenorge Design System is a fully fledged platform that implements our in-house components using various technology stacks such as React, Blazor (not yet started on) and more. Our design system comes out of the box with a documentation site which leverages patterns, principles and utilities to more efficiently build services and components for Helsenorge.

## ðŸ“¦ Packages

We use Lerna to manage our monorepo and list all our projects under the packages folder. Below is a list of published, unpublished and experimental packages and projects.

## ðŸ““ Documentation

To read the full design system documentation head over to our web page [Helsenorge Design](https://helsenorge.design/). Here you can read about our use of design principles, design language, patterns, compositions, live code examples and techincal component specifications.
